## 📝 Challenge Description

Can you see everything in the directory? If yes, read flag.txt and submit its contents.


# 🔎 Initial Enumeration

### Step 1 – Basic Check

`ls`

The `flag.txt` file was not visible in the directory.


### Step 2 – Check Hidden Files

`ls -a`

Output showed:

`.   ..   .ash_history   .flag.txt`


### Step 3 – Additional Enumeration

`pwd whoami env`

- Confirmed current directory.

- Verified running user.

- Checked environment variables (no useful info for this challenge).


## 👀 Observations

- No visible `flag.txt` file using normal `ls`.

- A hidden file named `.flag.txt` was present.

- Linux hides files that start with a dot (`.`).



# 🚧 Problem Identified

Explain the main trick:

- ✔ Hidden file (.)

- Filename starts with `.`

- No special permissions or encoding involved

- Simple Linux enumeration oversight


The trick was understanding that Linux hides files beginning with `.` from normal directory listings.


# 🛠 Exploitation / Solution

## Method Used

Command used:

`cat .flag.txt`

Explanation:

The `ls -a` command revealed the hidden file `.flag.txt`.  
Using `cat` on that file displayed the contents directly.


## Alternative Method (If Any)

`less .flag.txt`

or

`head .flag.txt`

Any file-reading command would have worked once the hidden file was identified.


# 📤 Command Used to Retrieve the Flag

`cat .flag.txt`

Output:

`NCA{YOu_fOund_HldDEn_1113_69S_faca8046a6b9}`


# 🚩 Final Flag

`NCA{YOu_fOund_HldDEn_1113_69S_faca8046a6b9}`


# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Always use `ls -a` during enumeration.

- Hidden files are extremely common in CTF challenges.

- Even very easy challenges test whether you skip basic steps.

- Enumeration is the foundation of penetration testing.



# 📚 Skills Practiced

- Linux Enumeration

- Shell Argument Parsing

- File Handling

- Problem-Solving Strategy



# 🏁 Personal Reflection

Next time, I will immediately run `ls -la` as part of my default enumeration checklist instead of relying on `ls` first.  
This saves time and avoids missing obvious hidden files.
