## 📝 Challenge Description

You know our FLAG already but are you aware of encodings too ??

---

# 🔎 Initial Enumeration

### Step 1 – Basic Check

```bash
ls
```

### Step 2 – Check Hidden Files

```bash
ls -a
```

### Step 3 – Additional Enumeration

```bash
pwd
whoami
env
sudo -l
ls -la /home/ctfplayer
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/group
cat /etc/shadow
ps aux
cat /proc/[PID]/cmdline
cat /proc/[PID]/environ
cat /proc/mounts
find / -user ctfplayer -type f 2>/dev/null
```

---

## 👀 Observations

- Only one user exists: `ctfplayer`.

- No `sudo` privileges available.

- Hidden `.ash_history` exists in `/home/ctfplayer`.

- Found a file owned by the user: `/var/log/weblog/wazuh/wazuh.log`.

- The content of `wazuh.log` appears to be Base64 encoded.

---

# 🚧 Problem Identified

- The flag is **hidden in a log file**.

- It is **Base64 encoded**, so direct reading will not reveal the flag.

- No elevated privileges are needed; user `ctfplayer` can read the file.


---

# 🛠 Exploitation / Solution

## Method Used

- Read the file:


```bash
cat /var/log/weblog/wazuh/wazuh.log
```

- Decode the Base64 content:


```bash
cat /var/log/weblog/wazuh/wazuh.log | base64 -d
```

- This successfully revealed the flag.


---

## Alternative Method (If Any)

- Use `base64 --decode /var/log/weblog/wazuh/wazuh.log` directly.


---

# 📤 Command Used to Retrieve the Flag

```bash
cat /var/log/weblog/wazuh/wazuh.log | base64 -d
```

Output:

```
NCA{some_7lmeS_Fla6_Ar3_3Nc0d3d66ee2648804e}
```

---

# 🚩 Final Flag

`NCA{some_7lmeS_Fla6_Ar3_3Nc0d3d66ee2648804e}`

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Always check for hidden files and log files in your home directory.

- Base64 encoding is commonly used in CTFs to hide flags.

- Basic enumeration and reading files with the correct tool (`base64 -d`) is often enough for simple challenges.


# 📚 Skills Practiced

- Linux Enumeration

- File Handling

- Encoding / Decoding (Base64)

- Reading hidden or obscure log files

---

# 🏁 Personal Reflection

Next time, I would directly check the user-owned files for potential hidden information instead of blindly searching system directories. Recognizing Base64 patterns can save time in decoding.
