## 📝 Challenge Description

I mistakenly deleted some commands, now I can't read -flag.txt. I hope you'll find the way.

---

# 🔎 Initial Enumeration

### Step 1 – Basic Check

```bash
ls
```

### Step 2 – Check Hidden Files

```bash
ls -a
```

### Step 3 – Additional Enumeration

```bash
pwd
whoami
env
echo *
echo /*
echo /home/*
```

---

## 👀 Observations

- Standard commands like `ls`, `cat`, `head` are missing (`command not found`), likely deleted.

- The flag file is named `-flag.txt`, which starts with a dash (`-`) making it look like a command option.

- File exists in `/home/ctfplayer/-flag.txt` as revealed by shell globbing with `echo *`.

- Shell built-in commands like `echo` are still functional.


---

# 🚧 Problem Identified

- Built-in commands (`ls`, `cat`, etc.) are missing.

- The filename starts with a dash (`-`), which normally confuses many commands.

- Need to read file without relying on deleted binaries.

- Shell globbing and built-in redirection can be used instead.


---

# 🛠 Exploitation / Solution

## Method Used

Used `echo` with input redirection to read the file:

```bash
echo "$(< ./-flag.txt)"
```

- `< ./-flag.txt` reads the contents of the file.

- `echo` prints the contents to stdout.

- This works even when standard commands like `cat` are unavailable because `echo` is a shell built-in.


---

## Alternative Method (If Any)

- `head -- -flag.txt` or `cat -- -flag.txt` would work if binaries were present.

- Using shell globbing: `echo *` reveals the file name and allows reading with built-ins.


---

# 📤 Command Used to Retrieve the Flag

```bash
echo "$(< ./-flag.txt)"
```

Output:

```
NCA{6U1It_iN_cOMMAnds_Are_V3Ry_P0WERfUIl9ed37e631058}
```

---

# 🚩 Final Flag

```
NCA{6U1It_iN_cOMMAnds_Are_V3Ry_P0WERfUIl9ed37e631058}
```

---

# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Shell built-ins can replace missing binaries.

- Filenames starting with `-` require special handling.

- Globbing (`*`) and redirection can bypass missing commands.


# 📚 Skills Practiced

- Linux Enumeration

- Shell Argument Parsing

- File Handling

- Problem-Solving Strategy

# 🏁 Personal Reflection

Next time, I would immediately check built-in alternatives when standard commands are missing. Using shell features like input redirection and globbing is faster than trying to restore deleted binaries.
