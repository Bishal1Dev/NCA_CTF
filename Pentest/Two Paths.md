## 📝 Challenge Description

There is always two way to solve a problem!!!


# 🔎 Initial Enumeration

### Step 1 – Basic Check

```bash
ls
```

No obvious flag file was visible.


### Step 2 – Check Hidden Files

```bash
ls -a
```

Output:

```
-flag.txt   .   ..   .ash_history
```


### Step 3 – Additional Enumeration

```bash
pwd
whoami
env
```

- Confirmed working directory.

- Verified current user.

- No useful environment variables related to the flag.



## 👀 Observations

- A file named `-flag.txt` exists.

- The filename starts with a dash (`-`).

- Linux commands interpret arguments starting with `-` as options.



# 🚧 Problem Identified

Explain the main trick:

- ✔ Filename starting with `-`

- Shell argument parsing issue


If we try:

```bash
cat -flag.txt
```

The system interprets `-f` as an option instead of treating `-flag.txt` as a filename.

This causes the command to fail.


# 🛠 Exploitation / Solution

## Method Used

### ✅ Method 1 – Use `./` to Specify Current Directory

```bash
cat ./-flag.txt
```

Explanation:

By adding `./`, we explicitly tell the shell that this is a file in the current directory, not a command option.


### ✅ Method 2 – Use `--` to Stop Option Parsing

```bash
cat -- -flag.txt
```

Explanation:

The `--` tells the command to stop parsing options.  
Anything after `--` is treated strictly as a filename or argument.

Both methods successfully display the flag.


## Alternative Method (If Any)

You could also rename the file:

```bash
mv -- -flag.txt flag.txt
cat flag.txt
```

But this is unnecessary for solving the challenge.


# 📤 Command Used to Retrieve the Flag

```bash
cat ./-flag.txt
```

Output:

```
flag{26501845-a551-485d-95a2-186afbfc872d}
```


# 🚩 Final Flag

```
flag{26501845-a551-485d-95a2-186afbfc872d}
```


# 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Filenames starting with `-` can break commands.

- Use `./filename` to reference files in the current directory.

- Use `--` to stop option parsing.

- Always understand how the shell parses arguments.

- Small syntax tricks are common in CTF challenges.



# 📚 Skills Practiced

- Linux Enumeration

- Shell Argument Parsing

- File Handling

- Problem-Solving Strategy



# 🏁 Personal Reflection

Next time, if I see a filename starting with `-`, I will immediately think about argument parsing issues instead of assuming the file is corrupted.  
This challenge reinforces the importance of understanding how Linux handles command-line arguments.
